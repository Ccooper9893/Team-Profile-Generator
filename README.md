# *Team-Profile-Generator*
![Badge image](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green})


## *Description*
___
This is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team via terminal and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Using the command line interface (CLI), answer the questions prompted in the terminal, and enjoy your newly generated Team Portfolio webpage!
Building this application has helped me hone my skills including OOP(Object oriented programming), TDD(Test driven development), node.js, and Javascript ES6.
